                        <p>One of my interests is breadboarding, which is a method of prototyping circuits with individual components and jumper wires. My biggest breadboarding project was a surprisingly complex 12 digit display run from an Arduino. The display is multiplexed, meaning each digit is activated one at a time and in quick enough succession to seem as if each led is lit simultaneously.
